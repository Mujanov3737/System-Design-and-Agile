# System-Analysis-and-Design

## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project centered around a client who was a driving education facility that felt there was a void in driving education services. The client felt that many students were failing to pass their driving certification exams and wanted a system that could help facilitate driving education and ultimately help their users pass their examinations. The many features of the system included the ability for users to schedule in-car driving appointments, access course materials, and take practice examinations. On the administrative side, the system also included login functionality, access control, and automatic notifications regarding licensing updates.

## What did you do particularly well?

I felt that the strongest point in the projects regarding the DriverPass system was how well I had accurately captured the requirements of the client and establishing the system requirements needed to fulfill them. Examining the interview transcript multiple times allowed me to pick out the details the client had wanted in the system and led me to create a strong requirements list to take into the next phases, such as developing use cases for what each actor might do or what the system may need to fulfill these requirements.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The use-case diagram would likely be the document I would want to revise if I were to go back. The diagram captures much of the functionality the system might have but I felt that perhaps the functionality of the customer could be more explicit. In the requirements document, the customer would need to choose which packages to purchase that would then authorize them for the appropriate functionality. This is implied in the use-case diagram but I feel it may read clearer if I were to have the customer first have a use-case of purchasing a package before they can take a test or schedule an appointment.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Many of the non-functional, functional, and technical requirements were derived from the initial meeting interview with the client. Additionally, other parts of the functionality were implied based on what is the general standard for applications like this is, such as a login system. For example, the client stated they wanted security and backups to be handled by a cloud-based provider as they did not want to deal with the infrastructure needed to support these functionalities in addition to wanting the system to be portable. This naturally inclines the system to be one that is web-based. It is important to understand these requirements when designing for a user’s needs because they will ultimately be the ones most often interfacing with the system. The user needs to have the proper functionality they expect to be available to them in the most convenient and secure manner possible so that the desired goal of the system can be fulfilled.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

This course has not only improved my understanding of the stages of the software development lifecycle, but also exposed me to the many methods of representation the various stages of the cycle and the components within in a graphical manner. Initially, I was only aware of class diagrams and how they may describe the structure of a system’s objects, but I am now aware of other techniques in graphical modeling such as sequence and activity diagrams which I will surely use in the future when designing or analyzing a system.
